QY measurements\par
\b0 Going to test PPO in LAB and PPO in EtOH initially.\par
PPO in EtOH has a known QY at 337 nm excitation.\par
The slits have been narrowed to give 2 nm wavelength resolution on excitation/emission.\par
I'll keep this wavelength resolution throughout.\par
The background will always be subtracted with a 5 second blank measurement.\par
\par
\b Sample key:\b0\par
Std = PPO in EtOH, 3.141 g/L\par
Samp = PPO in LAB, 2 g/L\par
Val = PPO in EtOH, diluted (concentration TBC)\par

\b0 Noticed odd behaviour in peak intensity: the EtOH samples exhibit little difference between 330 nm and 337 nm (<5%), whereas the LAB samples see a 43% decrease going from 337 to 330 nm excitation. I'm not sure why, but it may be due to strong absorption effects. Measuring at 340 nm, and I'll measure at 337 nm again later to check for drift in the instrument response.\par

The peak intensity at 340 nm excitation for the LAB sample is now comparable to the 330 nm excitation, and not comparable to the 337 nm excitation! I suspect I've smudged the cuvette somehow. I'll change the methodology now: I'll take all sample measurements first, the I'll take the standard measurements. This eliminates any systematic associated with changing the vial optics. I'll re-take the 337 nm excitation measurement to confirm this hypothesis.\par

The peak absorbance from this measurement was 10% higher than the previous measurement! This is concerning as the sample wasn't removed, so it suggests the instrument may not be stable. \par
Actually, on closer inspection, the RAW data looks like it agrees perfectly, so this is some correction error. This means that THE ANALYSIS MUST BE DONE ON THE RAW DATA (Corrections can be applied afterwards).\par

Turned on the lamp at 8:05 to warm it up.\par
The plan today is to do measurements with the dilute PPO and diluted bis-MSB in LAB samples.\par
I'll continue the measurements with the diluted PPO for now, though we probably need to go to a lower dilution to be sure we're avoiding sample geometry systematics.\par

- I'm suspecting there's a wavelength calibration offset between the fluorescence spectrometer box and the UV-VIS. The calibration chain is worked out as follows:\par
\tab * The fluorescent lights are measured and assumed to be known perfectly. This sets the absolute scale for the emission monochromator.\par
\tab * A scatter peak is measured in the box at a couple of wavelengths with an emission scan. This sets the absolute scale for the excitation monochromator.\par
\tab * A bandpass filter (nominally centred at 440 nm +/- 10 nm FWHM) is measured in the fluorescence spectrometer. The excorr signal is used, so the offset is only from the \tab   excitation monochromator.\par
\tab * The same bandpass filter is measured in the UV-VIS, to transfer the absolute wavelength calibration to it via the excitation monochromator.\par

The measurements in the box work, although the sensitivity to the wavelength calibration offset between the excitation monochromator and the UV-VIS monochromator is too high for these measurements to be too useful for PPO.\par
\par
The next task is to measure the QY in the sphere, now that I know how the excitation correction works.\par
\par
Firstly, measure the wavlength calibration offset between the excitation and emission monochromators...\par
\par
I'm seeing no counts with nothing in the sphere/box and the optics looking correctly set up on a sync scan... It's possible that the misalignment between the monochromator calibrations is to blame. Measuring this first...\par

Richard said he would prepare 15mg/L bisMSB in LAB for me, but it would take a few days because of bisMSB solubility.\par
Henry did some emission msmts with 1.26 mg/L PPO in ETOH. The sample with that conc. is marked as contaminated. \par
Available samples are 3.14, 0.31, 0.03 mg/L PPO in ETOH and pure ETOH. \par
Need absorption measurement in sphere for pure ETOH to determine absorption of PPO samples, so prepare and measure it first.\par
Following recollection of Henry, I will use 2.5 g of ETOH in 'sphere vial'.\par
So 8.3g for full vial corresponds to 2.5g of liquid as vial mass is 5.8g.\par
Note that Xe lamp has been left on since 2016-08-23\par
Lindsey said that the excitation range for PPO is 290-330 nm. Below 310 nm has essentially zero acceptance in the sphere, so I am limiting the range to 310-340 nm, inclusive.\par

I see clear emission with wide, featureless bump from ~340 to ~430 nm. There are ~300 counts at the peak and the baseline looks to be about ~50 counts.\par
Reference spectra from omlc.org/spectra/PhotochemCAD show absorption peak at 300nm, smaller peak at ~315nm and end of absorption at ~350nm for PPO in CYCLOHEXANE.\par
Fluorescence spectrum shows main peak at ~355nm, peak at ~80% of main peak at ~375nm, peak at ~60% of main peak at ~335nm with emission starting/ending at 330nm,460nm also for PPO in CYCLOHEXANE. I don't see any of these features but range and overall shape agree with PPO/CX reference.\par

Instead try emission scan to see Rayleigh peak. Empty frosted vial in box\par

See a nice peak at ~352nm. Do a better scan.\par

Looks like this can be used to figure out the offset.\par

Determine shift from empty_box_frosted_ex350nm_em330-370nm_2sec_20160901 by taking weighted mean of data around peak.\par
weighted mean (348,356) = 352.4nm (raw or corrected)\par
weighted mean (350.4,354.4) = 352.3nm (raw or corrected) <== USE THIS\par

Set "Em Mono 1" 352.3 as "Go to" and 350.0 as "Set"\par
\par
Now check with emission scan\par

No. That didn't work. Did I forget to hit "Set" (that is in my notes...). YES!\par
Try again\par
Set "Em Mono 1" 352.3 as "Go to", THEN CLICK "Go to" and 350.0 as "Set", THEN CLICK "Set". Should say "Monochromator calibrated"\par
