	REPLACED THE FLUORESCENCE SPECTROMETER LAMP TODAY

	PPO in Cyclohexane scans
	Emission scan; Exciting at 313nm; 300-600nm; 1 sec integration; 5 sec background;
	Excitation correction: excorr
	Emission correction: emcorr-sphere-quanta
	Gain: 6.8V

	Checked POPOP in cyclohexane for POPOP signature
	Informal, nothing saved or recorded.

	Made p-Terphenyl in cyclohexane series


Date: July 13, 2016

	Noticed today that monochromators must be calibrated differently for scans from the box or sphere for unknown reasons.
	
	After this date all measurements are standardized to the following criteriea:
		Excitation slits: 2mm
		Emission slits: 1mm
		1 sec integration with 5 sec background
		Measurments are always taken at 1 nm intervals
		The excorr correction is always used and a 6,8v gain is applied.
		If it is a scan using the Integrating Sphere, emcorr-sphere-quanta is always used.
		If it is a scan using the box, emcorri is always used.


Date: August 3, 2016

	Made PPO in etoh series


Date: August 5, 2016

	Made PPO in LAB, PPO in EtOH, and BisMSB in LAB series.


Date: August 8, 2016

	Recalibrated 2nd monochromator

	Made LAB in cyclohexane
	Three samples were made of LAB in Cyclohexane. The first became cloudy which was evidence of contamination as LAB and cyclohexane do not react. The second was not cloudy but saturated the UV-Vis spectrometer so a dilution was made giving the 3rd solution.
